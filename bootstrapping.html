        Initially, Itch.io was a site designed for <a href="leaf.html">Corcoran's</a> own use, and as it gained
        popularity
        Corcoran has needed to continually adapt in order to accommodate the users of his site. The
        humble start, using one’s own perspective to shape a site that would later be used by many,
        brings to mind Thierry Bardini’s Bootstrapping.
        <br><br>
        In Chapter Five, Bardini explains the
        development of the personal interface, where SRI staff worked to develop the NLS. The ways
        that SRI staff referenced older pieces of technology, such as using the teletype interface model,
        brings to mind the way Corcoran, on a smaller scale, took inspiration from the other sites around
        him.

    </div>

        Yet while Engelbart and his team were working to develop new technology, Corcoran is
        taking already existing systems and altering them to make them more accessible. Unlike on
        Steam which uses a closed system that requires payment and the games to be reviewed, there are
        no barriers to getting started on Itch.io. Itch has taken an existing closed system and made a
        more accessible alternative.
