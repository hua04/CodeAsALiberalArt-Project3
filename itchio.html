            Itch.io is a website that allows users to share and consume indie games. Created by <a href="leaf.html"> Leaf Corcoran</a>, Itch.io
            is meant to be a site that gets rid of the usual barriers preventing people from getting their games out
            there. Other game distribution sites, like Steam, require payment and review before hosting a game. Itch.io
            allows the user to just upload their game, add information and tags along with the files, and post them for
            all to see. Because of this, Itch.io has a lot of unconventional and experimental games that traditional
            distributors wouldn’t want to give a chance.
            <br><br>

            Though the site started out being for games, it has since evolved and now also contains books, game assets,
            zines, comics, music, and more. It’s growth also introduced the more community based aspects like <a href="bundles.html"> bundles</a>
            and <a href="gamejams.html">gamejams</a>.

            <br><br>

            Itch.io is known for being kind towards its users, going above and beyond to make sure each game’s launch
            goes exactly as the developer envisions it. Yet, Corcoran is part of a very small team, with him reporting
            that he is one of three people curating submissions. They do their best
            to go over all submissions, removing offensive content and malware, but it seems that the
            community does a good job at self-regulating regardless. The community on Itch.io seems to be
            one consisting of people who were attracted by Corcoran’s dream for a more accessible game
            sharing site that is compassionate towards its users, and seem to share many of his ideals.
