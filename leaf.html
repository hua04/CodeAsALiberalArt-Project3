            Itch.io is created by <a href="https://leafo.net/">Leaf Corcoran</a> , as a
            byproduct of another project. In 2013, Corcoran needed a place to put games he had made using
            a programming language he had created, called <a href="https://moonscript.org/">“Moonscript”</a>. Initially,
            Itch.io was a site designed for Corcoran’s own use, as he was frustrated by the inaccessabilty of other game
            distribution platforms. Yet it soon gained popularity, and
            Corcoran has continually adapted and update features in order to accommodate the users of his site.
            <br><br>
            Itch.io is not the main source of income for
            Corcoran, who has a full time job as a software developer. He is not concerned about the money, keeping the
            site
            free to use and even at times paying out of his own pocket for it. Corcoran is very passionate about the
            games
            on the site, often working closely with its users to adjust aspects to their liking and getting attached to
            the
            games on the site, being invested in their success and upset when they don’t do well. He runs the site on
            his
            own, with a small team, and reports that it has essentially eaten up all of his free time. Yet he doesn’t
            seem
            too upset about this.

            Corcoran’s approach to
            his site has been quite benevolent, Itch.io is clearly a labor of love.
            With the tech industry as it is now, Corcoran’s care and passion is refreshing and awe inspiring. It’s
            wonderful
            to see people who seem unconcerned with personal or financial gain, just doing things out of love for them.
