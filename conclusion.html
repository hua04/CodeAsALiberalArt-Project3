            All in all, based on this rudimentary algorithmic audit, Itch.io seems to be a site that
            prioritizes its user base. The nature of the site has attracted left leaning creators, and as a result
            many aspects of its culture promote themes of social justice and activism.

            <br>
            <br>
            Yet, there are also
            some concerns that can be raised due to Itch.io being run by one singular person.
            Though Corcoran seems to hold ideals shared within his community, there’s also a lot of
            information that’s hidden to the public, such as his process of review. There’s no way of knowing
            what he considers to be “inappropriate” and what he considers “good stuff” that is worthy of
            being boosted. Though the review system is manual and therefore avoids biases that are
            inherent within algorithms, it allows for human bias to take its place, which is perhaps more
            insidious and harder to track. There’s also the question of what happens to the games that have
            yet to be reviewed, as well as how long it takes for the review to actually happen after a game is
            posted. It’s an inefficient system that will probably fall apart as the site grows, if it hasn’t already.
            <br> <br>
            Itch.io seems to be much more “human” than other similar platforms, allowing for a
            benevolent culture to proliferate through the site. However, it is definitely not free from fault
            either, as some aspects regarding the underlying system and the distribution, or lack thereof, of
            control can be called into question. Yet so far, there do not seem to be any complaints, and it
            seems to have done a good job of fostering a compassionate and humanitarian community to
            exist within the site.
