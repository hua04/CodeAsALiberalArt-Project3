            Bundles on Itch.io are collections of games put togtether to be bought at a cheaper price than they would be
            when bought individually. Itch.io often puts together Charity Bundles as well, usually responding to current
            events.
            <br><br>
            Past bundles include
            an annually run “Queer Games bundle” to support queer game devs, the 2020 “Bundle for
            Racial Justice and Equality” to fundraise for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
            and the Community Bail Fund, the 2022 “Bundle for Ukraine” to raise money for International
            Medical Corps and Voices of Children, and the 2023 “TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida
            bundle” to fundraise for the charities Zebra Youth and Transinclusive Group.

            Not only can we see the userbase’s penchant for activism through these bundles, something that is also reflected in the <a href="gamejams.html">game jams</a> the site holds, but we
            can also see where the site seems to fall politically. According to these bundles, one would
            assume that Itch.io is fairly left leaning, and that seems to be supported by the fact that many of
            its top rated games feature themes of mental health and queerness alongside POC characters.
            These titles include the likes of "<a href="https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup">Butterfly Soup</a> - A visual novel about gay asian girls playing
            baseball and falling in love", "<a href="https://ncase.itch.io/anxiety">Adventures with Anxiety</a> - An interactive story about anxiety. You
            play *as* the anxiety", and "<a href="https://paranoidhawk.itch.io/lookouts">Lookouts</a> - A fateful meeting of queer outlaws in the desert". With
            the recent “GamerGate 2.0”, it seems fair to say that games like these could only thrive within
            Itch.io, as these themes are not widely accepted within the current gaming community.
