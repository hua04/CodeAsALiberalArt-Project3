        Ruha Benjamin comments on design and how the designer may be influenced in Chapter
        5 of Race After Technology by saying “it is vital to question which humans are prioritized in the
        process. Practically speaking, the human paying the designer’s bill is the one most likely
        prioritized”(pg 116). Itch.io manages to avoid this issue as it’s not the main source of income for
        <a href="leaf.html">Corcoran</a> who has a full time job as a software developer. 
        <br><br>
        The site is extremely flexible with its
        monetization. It allows developers to set the price for their games, also including a “pay what
        you want” option, and letting buyers pay above the minimum price. The developers also get to
        decide how the money is divided between the platform and creator, going so far as to not require
        the site get a cut at all. Corcoran has stated 
        that he wants the developers to “feel okay to put [the percentage] at zero,” as he doesn’t want to
        take a cut from someone who might desperately need it to cover their living expenses.

        <br><br>
        Corcoran has also said that he gets “emotionally attached” to the
        games posted on Itch.io, feeling anxiety over their success. This genuine care towards the site
        can be reflected by the way Corcoran works with developers. Developers have reported that
        reaching out is met with a quick and enthusiastic response, as “almost everyone has a story about
        how Corcoran personally went above and beyond to help them achieve their vision for release”.
        <br><br>
        All in all, it seems safe to say that Corcoran’s approach to designing and Itch.io feels like
        it prioritizes humans in a way that Benjamin might approve of. Though it still does contribute to
        and participate in capitalism, as money is involved in the process of both maintaining the site and
        the distribution of games on it, it feels like Corcoran has been able to build a site that’s less
        concerned with financial gain and more concerned with spreading love for games. It feels
        significantly more “human” than the alternatives out there.
