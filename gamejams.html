            Game jams are events where participants try to make a game from scratch within a short period of time. These
            jams can have themes, rankings, and/or prizes. One of the most famous examples of this is <a
                href="https://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a>, first held in April 2002 and now being held twice a year
            yearly.

            <br><br>

            Game jams have evolved into a staple of Itch.io, with a calendar on the site showing many
            ongoing or upcoming jams at any given time. The jam calendar shows a month before and two months after the
            current date, with the colored bars showing the length of these jams. The jams listed are usually quite open
            ended to allow
            participants to be as creative as possible. Usually the jams will just have one central theme that the
            participants need to include, such as a genre of game, a visual style, a kind of trope, a color, etc. These
            themes are meant to inspire while setting some base guidelines/expectations.

            The
            jam calendar contains jams like “Bullet Hell
            Jam” or “Pixel Game Jam”, but also jams like “Safe In Our World Mental Health Game Dev
            Champions”, “Climate Jam”, and “Games For Love's Cause Jam”, which is a jam which aims to
            fundraise to support children in hospitals.
            These jams play a huge part in building up the community's voice and culture, one that, as can be seen from
            the above jams, leans humanitarian. This humanitarian culture can also be seen in the <a
                href="bundles.html">bundles</a> that Itch.io organizes and promotes.
